what questions did i ask?

q: is the number of elements always the same as the level of the triangle assuming the first level is starting at 1?
a: yes

q: therefore, every odd level always has an odd count of elements and every even has an even count of elements?
a: yes

q: is the outer element always 1?
a: yes

q: is the middle most element or pair of elements never more than half of the sum of all elements in the series of that level?
a: no, the first level's middle element is 100% of the series

q: do the first half of elements in the series follow a pattern of the difference between each pair of neighboring elements?
a: there is a pattern there, but i'm not math-smart enough to make use of it. its obviously related to how each column affects the pattern. since i can't derive a rank entirely based off of that without referencing other ranks, its not useful to me.

q: are there maybe more patterns here than i likely could find in the week or so this toy problem will keep my attention for this year?
a: yep. cheated and grabbed this http://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/combinatorics/PascalTriangleProperties.shtml

q: wait, is that ùëí showing up in middledivsum.txt?
